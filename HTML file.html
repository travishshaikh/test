<summary><b>Deferral of special assessments and/or property taxes-Qualifications for deferral.</b></summary>
 
</HD><ST>(1)<b>Introduction.</b> This rule describes the qualifications a person (claimant) 
  must meet to qualify for a deferral of special assessments and/or real property taxes 
  on residential housing.

(2) <b>Qualifications for deferral.</b> A claimant may defer payment of special 
  assessments and/or real property taxes on up to eighty percent of the amount of 
  their equity value in their residence if the following conditions are met:

(a) Ownership. The claimant must have owned, at the time of filing, the 
residence on which the special assessment and/or real property taxes have been 
imposed. For purposes of this rule, a residence owned by a marital community, a 
state registered domestic partnership, or cotenants will be deemed to be owned by
each spouse, each domestic partner, and each cotenant. A claimant who has only a
share ownership in cooperative housing, a life estate, a lease for life, or a revocable
trust does not satisfy the ownership requirement.

(b) Fire and casualty insurance. If the amount deferred will exceed one 
hundred percent of the claimant's equity value in the land or lot only, the claimant 
must have and keep in force fire and casualty insurance in sufficient amount to 
protect the interest of the state of Washington and designate the state as a loss 
payee on the policy. The deferred amount may not exceed the amount of the insured
value of the improvement plus the land value.

(c) Installment method. For special assessment deferrals, the claimant
 must have opted for payment of the special assessments on the installment method if that
method was available.

(d) Income. The claimant must have a combined disposable income, as 
defined in RCW <a href="">84.36.383</a>, equal to or less than the income threshold defined in
RCW <a href="">84.38.020</a>.

(e) Age. The claimant must be sixty years of age or older on December 31st
of the year in which the deferral claim is filed, or must have been at the time of filing,
retired from regular gainful employment by reason of disability as defined in 
RCW <a href="">84.36.383</a>. However, any surviving spouse, surviving domestic partner,heir,or
devisee of a person who was receiving a deferral at the time of the person's death 
qualifies if the surviving spouse,surviving domestic partner, heir, or devisee is fifty-
seven years of age or older and meets the requirements of the deferral.

(f) Other requirements.The claimant must meet all requirements for an
exemption for a residence under RCW <a href="">84.36.381</a>, other than the age and income 
requirements, and to the extent eligible, must have first applied for the exemptions
under RCW <a href="">84.36.381</a> through <a href="">84.36.389</a> prior to filing a declaration to defer.
